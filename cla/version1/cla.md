# Contributor License Agreements

Whenever someone wants to submit a patch to open source projects, they must first sign a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). This allows the contributor to retain their ownership in the code submitted while granting
the project owner the necessary legal rights to use that contribution. The CLA only needs to be signed once
and it covers projects by the same project owner.

## Why do we even have a CLA?

Our CLA allows open source projects administered by the project owner to safely accept code and documentation
from external contributors.

## What's in the CLA?

Our CLAs are based on the Apache Software Foundation's CLAs.

* [Corporate CLA](corporate-cla.md) - For entities signing on behalf of their employees.
* [Individual CLA](individual-cla.md) - For individuals.
